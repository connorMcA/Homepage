            <p>I am a big fan of minimalism in all its forms. From music to art to furniture I love it all.
            So, when I saw this video, I was inspired to create something similar of my own. Reading
            about how Floating Points created the images using an oscilloscope connected to his synths
            peaked my interest and I wanted to try something similar. First I just messed around using
            javascript and drawing to an html canvas. As I got interested in graphics programming I
            thought this would be a perfect place to get started by porting it to C.</p>

            <p>After playing around for some time I was able to get it to a place that I like.
             It was a lot of trial and error to try and get it to look right but while
             messing around with it I came across a lot of other interesting results.
             Besides the Epitrochoid, as I found out the shape was called, I played with
             other parametric equations to create some interesting oscillations. The project
             is still a work in progress; I have more to port to C from javascript and there
             is plenty of optimization to do. I am really excited to see where this goes though.</p>
