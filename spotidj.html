        <p>An Android application written in Java that utilizes Spotify's API to search, access, and play songs. The main focus of the program is to allow many people to connect their phone (clients) to one person's phone (server), then search Spotify's songs and push them over to a queue on the server. Currently I have added the ability to play/pause, skip forward and back, and add tracks on the server. The next set of features I want to add are the following: change the queue, remove tracks, allow the client to see the queue, and allow the server to see exactly which song is playing. </p>

        <p>This idea was inspired by a party I went to, where one person had their phone hooked up to the speakers, and allowed people to put songs on the queue. I had to ask her to enter her password each time since it would lock after a while. I thought it would be much easier to have some way to simply push the song I wanted to her phone, rather than ask her to give me access to her entire phone too add a song. This would also give the host more abilities to tackle requests and better refine the experience of the party.</p>
