    This is a version of Asteroids that I made for one of my classes. It is almost identical to the version on my <a href="https://github.com/connorMcA/Asteroids">GitHub</a> but that one was made in MonoGame and this was made in Unity. It varies from the normal Asteroids in that at the beginning you can choose a different fire mode for the ship. Currently I am working on adding a highscore feature to keep track of the top 10 scores. Feel free to email me with any suggestions or bugs!
